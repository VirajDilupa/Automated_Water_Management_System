# Automated_Water_Management_System
This project automates water supply management by switching to a storage source when the primary supply fails. It adjusts pH levels by adding chemicals (HCl or NaOH) when outside the desired range. If a filter malfunctions, the system automatically switches to a backup filter, ensuring continuous operation.
